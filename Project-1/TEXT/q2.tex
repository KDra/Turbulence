\section*{Question 2}

\textit{ Plot the Probability Density Function (PDF) of the streamwise velocity gradient (i.e. $^{\partial u_1} / _{\partial x_1}$) from both datasets and calculate its first four moments. Using the moment information, comment on type of distribution exhibited by gradients in the two sets of data. Use Taylorâ€™s hypothesis to convert temporal gradient to spatial gradient.}

Figure \ref{dudx1} shows the probability distribution of $\partial u_1 / \partial x_1$ for \emph{flow 1}. The curve shows that the velocity derivative to be more evenly distributed for this flow than the second flow case (fig. \ref{dudx2}).

\emph{Kurtosis} is a measure of how 'spread out' a distribution is and it is often compared to the number $3$, given by the \emph{Gaussian} distribution. A kurtosis lower than this is said to be \emph{platykurtic} and a higher value is said to be \emph{leptokurtic}.
\emph{Skewness} shows if the data has more outliers towards the right (positive) or left end of the tails.

Table \ref{tbl2} shows that the high variance and low kurtosis suggest a more 'spread out' distribution for \emph{flow 1} when compared to the second. The second flow case is highly leptokurtic and the first is platykurtic but with a kurtosis close to that of a gaussian. The second case has more positive outliers due to the skewness of $0.55$ whereas in the first flow case the datapoints are well centered ($\emph{S} \approx 0$).
