\section*{Question 3}
\textit{Using the homogenous isotropic assumptions and Taylor's hypothesis, calculate the dissipation rate from the dataset. Assume kinematic viscosity, $\nu = 1.5 \times 10^{-5} m^2/s$.}

Dissipation is given by:
\begin{equation}
\epsilon = 15 \nu \left\langle\left[\frac{\delta u}{\delta x}\right]^2\right\rangle
\end{equation}
Which gives $\epsilon_{flow 1} = 1.09 \times 10^4\ ^J/_{kg \cdot s}$ and $\epsilon_{flow 2} = 166.4 ^J/_{kg \cdot s}$. This shows that a larger amount of energy is transformed from turbulent flow energy to heat in the first flow case which means that higer amounts of energy are lost in the first flow case.
