\section*{Question 10}
\textit{Based on everything you have seen from the results, what can you say about the nature of flows in “flow1” and “flow2”.}

This can be interpreted as large range of eddy sizes passing by the hot wire probe which would suggest that it is placed near a body in a high $Re$ flow.

In contrast, figure \ref{dudx2} shows that most values are near $0$ which suggests that the flow has mostly eddies of a similar size.
