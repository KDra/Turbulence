\section*{Question 2}

\textit{ Plot the Probability Density Function (PDF) of the streamwise velocity gradient (i.e. $\partial u_1 / \partial x_1$) from both datasets and calculate its first four moments. Using the moment information, comment on type of distribution exhibited by gradients in the two sets of data. Use Taylorâ€™s hypothesis to convert temporal gradient to spatial gradient.}
