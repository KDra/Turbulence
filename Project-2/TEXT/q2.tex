\section*{Question 2}

\emph{Use the exact solution as an initial condition for your simulations and compare the numerical results
against the exact ones at a later time. Consider whether the integral ’constants’ $A = \int_{-\infty}^\infty f dx$ and $  E =  \int_{-\infty}^\infty \tfrac{1}{2} f^2 dx$ are conserved (or not) as appropriate.}
