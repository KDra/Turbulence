\section*{Question 3}
\emph{Investigate the solutions when the viscosity is very small (in effect, zero) so that we reduce to the one-dimensional wave equation. Look the amplitude (growth/decay, stability) and dispersion (phase speed of wave components. One way to retain stability is to add an optimal small amount of artificial viscosity (e.g. the Lax-Wendroff method, Euler+CDiff2, using $\nu = 0.5 c^2 dt$).}
