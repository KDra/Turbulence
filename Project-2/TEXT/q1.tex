\section*{Question 1}
\emph{Investigate the stability and accuracy of the four schemes in terms of the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) numbers $\lambda = c \tfrac{dt}{dx}$ and $\mu = \nu \tfrac{dt}{{dx}^2}$. In particular use numerical experimentation and/or von Neumann stability analysis to determine stability boundaries.}



The stability boundary is probed numerically by varying dt, since the convection and diffusion are fixed. Changing $\Delta x$ is also unnecessary since $k = \sigma/c = 0.05$ and in consequence $k \Delta x \approx 3.6\times 10^{-4} \ll 2\pi$. The code in Listing \ref{code1} was used to probe the stability boundary numerically for increasing $\Delta t$. The criteria for changing the truth flag is stored in the
